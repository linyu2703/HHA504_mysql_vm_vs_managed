# Comparison
## (A) Small student app
For a small student app, a managed database would suffice. It offers automatic backups, simple setup, low cost, and enough performance for lightweight workloads. This allows students to focus on building the project rather than managing infrastructure.

## (B) Departmental analytics DB
For a departmental analytics database, a self-managed MySQL VM is best, as it provides valuable flexibility in user permissions, query tuning, and resource configuration—useful for complex analytics. Still, if the team prefers lower maintenance or needs built-in monitoring and automated scaling, a managed database can be an equally strong option.

## (C) HIPAA-aligned workload
For a HIPAA-aligned workload, a managed database is best, as it offers built-in compliance support, strong encryption, audit logging, automated backups, and high availability—reducing risk and removing much of the operational burden from the team while ensuring PHI is handled securely.
